// Write up the two tests here and make sure they are testing what the title shows

  //Arrange

  //Act
  //I needed to submit the form first so I can have the success message
  const checkoutButton = getByText("Checkout");
  //I learned this way by checking out this link https://testing-library.com/docs/example-input-event
  fireEvent.click(checkoutButton);
